@title[]{About Me}

Hi! I'm Connor, a software engineer relocating to Berkeley with my partner, Emily, and my dog, Dex. I've been writing software in one form or another for a decade, from real time sensor processing to cloud applications. When I'm not writing code, you can find me reading, up in the mountains, or at a workbench in a makerspace.
