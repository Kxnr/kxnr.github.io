@title[]{About Me}

Hi! I'm Connor, a software engineer relocating to Berkeley with my partner, Emily, and my dog, Dex. I've been writing software in one form or another for a decade, from real time sensor processing to cloud applications. When I'm not writing code, you can find me reading, up in the mountains, or trying to put something I've taken apart back together again.
